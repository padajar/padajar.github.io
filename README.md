# Minimal Mistakes

If you enjoy the layout of this website and its content, it's based off of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). The easiest way to get started with it is to [**use this template**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate).

It can also be configured as necessary following the documentation [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).
