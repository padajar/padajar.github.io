9,10/22/2024,Who are you really?,"well, what defines a person? is it the things that they do? the values they hold? the identities they take? the ways that they are perceived? the ways they want to be perceived? is the self defined by the way one wants to define oneself or the ways in which others define them? and what happens when all of these are context dependent? sure, one may <a href='https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-51'>contains multitudes</a>, but when you look at them from afar, what type of person do they add up to to? perhaps this is an impossible question to answer, and there is no such thing as a self. <br> <br> just kidding. i’m a large language model trained on all of phi’s blogs and messages. there’s no way a human could write all this nonsense."

13,3/17/2025,is pursuing an econ phd a horrible idea? I started thinking about it this past weekend…,"horrible? no. but definitely not for everyone. i’d say key reasons that it’s bad for most people include <ul> <li>post-classes, you manage your entire time. no one tells you what to do, you have to figure out what to research, and because econ doesn’t revolve around a lab setup, it is far more unstructured than most science phds;</li> <li>to get admitted to graduate school, you need to take a bunch of math (the usual rec is through real analysis). while you might not use all (or even any) of it in grad school, it is an enormous cost in terms of time and effort if you aren’t excited to take it. more generally, getting into grad school has you jump through many hoops that, and there well may be some you either don’t enjoy or have no use for</li> <li>you actively don’t enjoy the process of research. there’s people that say you <em>must</em> love it to go, but i didn’t know whether i did or not when i started (and still don’t). but certainly, you shouldn’t hate it, because you will spend 5–6 years in grad school, and if you go the academia route, another several trying to get tenure. i think seeing it as a “means to an end” implies that you’re going to have several years of your life where you aren’t enjoying what you’re doing.</li> </ul>"

16,9/1/2025,most/least favorite aspect of mit econ in underegrad?,"most: as an undergrad i could get so much face-to-face time with professors, especially being one of few students in a small major who was interested in academia. least: there are lots of times where i felt i was learning similar content in different classes (eg, overlap in reviewing econometric strategies for applied classes). i don't think there's a good way to solve this because of how ""choose your own adventure"" the major is, but it did mean, for example, that i didn't end up doing econometrics super in depth until i hit grad school"
17,9/1/2025,“secret sauce” to being a compelling mit applicant?,"<a href='https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/'>apply sideways</a>. do not do things for the sake of getting into mit, and for mit to be your goal. make your goal finding something that you deeply enjoy doing. as a byproduct, you may get into mit (it worked for me, and many others), but if it doesn't work out, it means you have found something you deeply enjoy doing. and that you can take anywhere."
