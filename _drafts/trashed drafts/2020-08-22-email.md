One of my core experiences of being at MIT is e-mail; it is truly a blessing and a curse and a blessing at the same time. Now, depending on who you are and which dorm you're in (if any), you'll experience MIT email very differently. If you're not on dormspam[^1] and you're not on any email-heavy clubs, you might end MIT with only a few thousand emails. However, if you're like me, and you are on dormspam and in an email heavy-club, your MIT experience might look much more like the following.

[insert screenshot of 70 thousand emails]

At this point, you might be thinking how in the world anyone can maintain a semblance of order in when they have an average of (do the math of how many emails a day) in their inbox — all of these emails are marked as read, and I've actually read/skimmed around ~2/3 of them. I'll walk you through my system of sorting emails at MIT[^2], but before we get there, it's useful to give a background about how email lists at MIT work. 

## email lists

When you enroll at MIT, you choose a Kerberos ID for yourself, affectionately called a "kerb"; this email is your login for almost everything at this school. It also occasionally becomes more than that; I know many people who go entirely by their Kerberos rather than their *actual names*. It's pretty fun, and it's why choosing your kerberos is important (insert blog posts.)

However, if you only got emails when they were sent to your kerb, life would be incredibly hard. Imagine you're a club president and you want to email all of your members; manually adding everyone's email address every single time you email sounds like an absolute pain. (This same situation arises if you're a professor trying to email a class about homework, a student trying to email your wing to publicize something, etc.)

That's where mailing lists come in. 
mailing list, (n). an email address that, when an email is sent to it, sends the email to each member of said list. 2, the coolest thing in the world 

I literally had no conception of how this could work in high school; while my school did have email, things were sent to all students or to this big bcc list

The most communly used kind of list is a Moira list.

talk about hte settings public/privvate, hidden/visible, ??? 

OK, but how can these mailing lists actually be used in practice? Let's say I'm running some student club, like People for the Appreciation of Orange Loungewear Onesies (also known as PAOLO). There's various groups that we might imagine sending emails to (the president, the events officer, the social officer, all members as a whole, just exec members). Inside of Moira, we can set up different mailing lists for each of them, like `paolo-prez@mit.edu`, `paolo-events@`, `paolo-social@`, `paolo-members@`, `paolo-exec@`. You can also add mailing lists *to* mailing lists; so, `paolo-exec` could contain `paolo-prez`, `paolo-events`, and `paolo-social`. This is great because when elected officers change, you don't have to change all of the lists — you just need to change the "base" one and all lists that need it are recursively added. Nested mailing list structures can simplify a lot of the transitioning between 

Ok, so why might this be useful? Let's now say that PAOLO wants a public email that outsiders can use to get in contact with the club. If we just publicize the email list  `paolo-members` to the world, then someone outside of our club could email `paolo-members`. Say there's a lot of people that want to contact us, and `paolo-members` is sent literally hundreds of emails a day. This makes email communication to all members much more difficult; it's so much easier to lose 1 important email when there's hundreds of other emails to the same address. The solution? Make *another* mailing list, like `paolo-external` (containing only the list `paolo-members`) and publicize *that* email list to the world. That way, you can distinguish between the level of importance of an email *using only what email list it is sent to*. (I'll talk about *how* to do this in the filters section.)

There's a second kind of list which is also very useful at MIT: a *Mailman* list. These lists function very similarly to the above lists: you can create Mailman lists with any (unused) name, and when you send an email to the list, it gets forwarded to all members of that list. However, there's a slight difference with these lists: Mailman lists can be *moderated*, which means you can do cool things like

paolo-announce@



* limit who can send to this list, approving/rejecting every incoming email before it gets sent otu
* add in useful things like headers in the subject of your emails, etc
* name some other htings mailman can do. unsubscribe links?

very useful for sending things out to super external lists with many people that you don't just want anyone to be able ot send to



## email lists at mit

* talk about dormspam
* other common mailing lists include a mailing list for free food on campus, pictures of hte sky right now, etc
* individual floors/dorms often have hteir own mailing lists for different purposes
  * jobs announce, spam, pick up your laundry, "ovreheard / who said it"
* 





## email workflows

* different clients

  * outlook
  * gmail (most commonly used)
  * poeple use many others, like thunderbird or whatever you want
  * basically just needs to connect to owa
  * will go into gmail things becuase i'm most familiar with them

* now for my favorite part — how do you make a workflow htat can handle tens of thousands of emails?

  * need some system that can tell you abou hte importance of it

    * different mailing lists / keywords tell you a lot
    * who it's from
    * keywords in the email

  * i have different filters + emails for career fair resume things, for blogging, things reltaed to my urop

    

  



Other uses for mailing lists; 

## 

* email filters are a joy
* large number of emails
* talk about my system of email filters





[^1]: dormspam: the collective social mailing lists of all dorms, often used to publicize events, polls, or start flame wars
[^2]: cough if you are a senior and applying to college having some kind of system to sort through the millions of spamming emails from certain colleges can be very useful
