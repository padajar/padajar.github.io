title: "online communities"

The new outline:

* some introductory notes:
  * i know that i come from a weird places saying all of this, as someone who has already gone through the proess and objectively ended up at a good college.
  * but i do come from a place of having understood what these places were like as they were growing. was involved in when it had <5k people. (friends don’t judge pls)
  * since becoming a blogger, i’ve poked my head into these places a few times just to see what they’re like and how i reflect on them 4 years down the line. 
  * i will say right here at hte beginning that i do not have solutions. what i want to do is to start a discourse and get people thinking. 



* Starting philosphically: what is hte goal?
  * i have already talked plenty about my process of trying to find a goal and meaning. 
  * j
  * j



* where does culture come from?
  * culture, by definition, is a collective. 
  * this is a point htat i have thought about a lot for hte purposes of clubs that i’m involved in, and that i continue to think about a lot
  * in amorphous orgainzatoins, it is very, vrey difficult for culture to be directed by any one person. rather, culture comes as hte agglomeration of millions of individual actions. 



* By nature, the existence of a forum implies that the goal is about where you go.
  * there’s plenty of things about how 99% of america will only ever know a handful of poeple that go to top places, and suddenly you see everyone doing it and its a rat race
  * a forum naturally dedicated to trying to get into places: “forum for undergraduate college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to SAT/ACT test prep, career guidance, and more” -a*c, 
  * literal industries built around essay help, preparing it – see college admissions scandal
  * there’s even the bajillion posts about “manifestation” and how you just think abut it
* goodhart’s law: when a metric becomes salient it ceases to be a good metric
  * leadership, high test scores, “authenticity and vulnerability”, become performative things, rather than a virtue in and of themselves
* mental health
  * you have posts about how people feel empty, worthless, etc. “The more I work on college apps, the more I realize how worthless I am”
  * “it’s just emptiness? like not in a depressive sort of way just like a neutral sort of way. in an i-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life sort of way? like i just feel lost and writing college essays feels like the biggest chore but c’est la vie, right?”
  * “Anything that you write within the next 5 days will determine your future for the rest of your life.”
  * the 2 sides of A2C
    1. College isn't that big of a deal.
    2. ONWARDS TO VICTORY FELLOW SENIORS!
* yes, there are memes and rants and shitposts. yes, sometimes they’re even good. (i wouldn’t know.)
* i do not want to discount good things which happen as a part of these forums: sharing opportunities (scholarship, questbridge)  and especially to underserved communities
  * places to find factual advice
  * 



on *those* college app forums



\So it’s application season for everyone. I’m applying for grants (submitted my first one on Monday!), graduate schools in economics, the occasional RA and job posting. Other people are applying for internships, and most people reading these blogs are going to be applying to college.

To all of the (high school) seniors: let me tell you, I do not envy you in the *slightest*. The application that I just submitted involved 5 pages of writing where I had to talk about experiences that shaped me and propose a research project, and I’ve just had this intense feeling of déjà vu. The throwback of revising essays over and over again to try and be me, of writing and re-writing 150-character descriptions of the hundreds of hours I spent on extracurriculars, and being scared about how the future would turn out.

I’m not feeling in an app-writing mood at the moment, and so I figured I’d procrastinate for a bit. And there’s no better way to procrastinate on writing than writing on topics semi-related to the things you really should be writing about.

The internet is filled with quite interesting subcultures, people dedicated to literally anything that you can possibly imagine. And some of these communities talk about college admissions a lot. I’m not going to name any by names, because that would be rude. But as someone who was involved in these places once upon a time, and also someone who things about how to model human behavior using economics, and *also* someone who thinks a lot about education, I’d feel somewhat remiss if I was a blogger for a year on an *admissions* website and didn’t talk about this. 

I’ve got three distinct things I want you to get out of this post.

1. I want you to see *a* way in which economists see the world. I’m going to talk about these online communities by using theoretical economics models that I’ve either seen in different classes or have made myself to roughly approximate the behavior of people. Now, to be clear, this isn’t the entirety of economics; many classes that people take here at MIT talk about ways to put these models to the test using experimental or quasi-experimental (annotation: while sometimes it is possible to run experiments to test out economic theories, like Gautam Rao paper who tests peer effects in idea using a randomized controll trial, the technique that helped win esther and abhijit the 2019 nobel prize, there’s also times where it’s unethical to run experiments, like if we wanted to understand how TV impacts poeple’s social networks (olken paper). in these cases, quasi-experimental methods where we use natural properties fo the setting to make conclusions about causality. (and remember, correlation is not causality.) ) methods. But it’s one aspect of economics indeed, and so I figured I’d economics-nerd on y’all for a little bit. 
2. I want you to take a step back and understand these communities in the larger context of admissions, and understand what parts of these communities are valuable and what parts aren’t. I’m not going to say that 



What are the goals of this post?

1. Show poeple economics things that I think are interesting, and the fact htat economics is incredibly applicable to things.
2. people to take a step back and view communities like applying to college, college confidential, differently



Things to talk about.

* Feeling bad seeing poeple with high stats (market for lemons)

* Misinformation getting passed aroudn (degroot / bayesian learners)

  * but also, occaisonaly good things get shared

* Things contributing to a stress culture; something with nrom-setting?

  * people from uber-competitive high schools where people have been striving to do things to get to the top
  * people with accss to less resources, scouring the internet for advice
  * people with 
* There is a Stress.
  * This, for almost all people applying to college, is hte first major thing that you’ve applied to that feels very Real and Consequential. It is a stress.
  * There is the fear of judgement; these are poeple who are avtively judging hte last 3 years of your life, and indirectly judging your existence. The inseucirty.
  * there is the feeling of trying to figure out your path; if you hadn’t already worried about it before, there’s intended majors, there’s schools that make you apply to specific departments, etc.
* Put all of these people into an anonymous forum, and what do you end up getting?
  * There is a shouting into the void of stress, and trying to make sure you’re not alone. in particular, there is the “oh god everything is absolutely hopefully and i’m never going to get into anywhere”
  * there is a shouting into the void of “i’m qualified enough” which can manifest itself as asking poeple to validate your stats, sharing your experiences, being arrogant about your qualifications, or putting poeple down.
  * there’s the fact that no one actually knows whats going on and misinformaiton spreads; anyone giving advice is either selling something, extrapolating from their own experience.  sure, facts get spread and this is useful. 
  * poeple always saying that they should wokr but they don’t
  * there is the insecuritues. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jedxjp/is_kidney_failure_and_transplant_a_valid_reason/
  * **Implicitly, everyone knows that there are issues.** I don’t think that anyone genuinely believes that their peers can really super accurately tell them about chance mes, becuase no one can. but we go out and trry to seek validation anways…
* where does this leaD?
  * fora centered around something means tha tpoeple ascribing even higher importance to it than they did previously? 
  * disappointment at seeing others get in when you don’t
  * more informal chat mechanisms where poeple create entire subcultures aroundthis
  * perhaps a forgetting about hte important things.
  * people finding it younger and younger – i’ve seen 8th graders poke their heads in thinking about it that early.
