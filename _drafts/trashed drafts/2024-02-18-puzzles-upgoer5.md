Another writer here has already talked about The School’s Big Game, a fun thing that happens here at this school over the weekend to honor the man who had a dream. I also did The School’s Big Game, also with people from my [use rfong language]. This team is very young: we started doing the game together about five years ago, but in the last few years, we have become a team that is actually pretty good and it is really weird. We were hoping to finish The Big Game this year (but not win, because we are not yet ready to write The Big Game, unlike other writers here) [link to CJ, rfong]. We got very, very close — we were only three [meta puzzles] away — but we were very proud of how we did even so. We did the best that we have ever done (about sixth! one of the top teams that didn’t finish). We are excited about next year’s Big Game, and hope that we can finish that one :) 



I thought it would be fun if I talked about some of the games I had fun with a few weeks ago, trying to explain them in “up-goer five” style :)

Right now, there is no place that has the original games. When there is, I will link to them! This should happen soon, I hope.

I’ll talk about three games in this writing! I will put the games without answers at the top, so that you can try them if you want without me telling you the answers. [I am sad that I can’t up-goer-five the games, but … doing so would make them not work. But I will talk about how to do them only with the ten-hundred most used words! This will be fun…]

NOTE THAT THIS WRITING HAS THE FULL WAY OF “HOW TO DO” THESE GAMES. DO NOT READ THIS POST IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.

Here, we have a list of words. Maybe let’s start by trying to see what some of these words are. It’s a little hard, because there are a lot of words that could be these words. But we can write all of the “maybe” words off to the side for now.

It seems like the words on the left might have an order (from the first letter to the last)! We can use that idea to try and guess a few more words.

At this point, we might try to look at the “taste text” on the top. Sometimes, the taste text has a small idea about what is supposed to happen in this game. Here, it does have a small idea! The title of the game has one more letter than the last word in the taste text. Maybe the words on the right are supposed to have one more letter than a word on the right :o 

If we look at a word on the left side, we might be able to find some things that work like this! Now that we know the “main idea” of this game, we can write some more words on both the left *and* right.



Now we’ve filled in all of the words … and … what now? We did all of the work but nothing tells us how we are supposed to *do* the rest of the game.



Well, let’s think about the things in this game that have not been used yet. Well, there was the fact that each word pair had “one more letter”. By each word on the right, let’s write down that letter.

These make some words! This makes us think that we have the right idea. But we are not done yet; THEM CRAB ALLY ZEROS is not the right thing to send in for this game. What else should we do?!

At the bottom of this game, we see (3 10). Probably this is about the final thing to send in for this game — two words, the first being three long and the second being ten long.

Our words that we got from the “one more” letters are ten-and-seven long, and there are four words, and ten-and-seven is four more than ten-and-three. Maybe this is a game with a “do it again” idea — we have to take this set of words, and then do the “big idea” of this game one more time.

And it IS! If we take a letter out of each word that we have here, we can turn this into words that are as long that we want them to be: THE CAB ALL EROS -> THE CABALLEROS.

The title of this game made us think “of course! this game is about the school that we are at”! And so we start putting words for each of these ideas. And they fit the blanks! That’s great! After a while, you know what all of the words are supposed to be (maybe you know some of these off the top of your head, if you really like this school, or if you have been here for a long time, like me)
