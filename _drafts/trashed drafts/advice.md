and so it comes to pass
one last time
what matters most

 Trying to piece together my final reflections about MIT, and maybe even throw in some advice about it all. 

But there’s some problems with this — I don’t feel well prepared to either reflect *or* to give advice.

On the reflection side, I haven’t been doing great at reflecting recently. I tend to be a pretty introspective person, which I think comes through in [many](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/17707-words/) [of](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/on-success-meaning-and-time/) [my](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/continuing/) [posts](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/leaning-in/). As of recent, though, my posts have more been about [things that I’ve done](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-change-policies-at-mit-joint-post-with-rona-w/), [how-tos](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-draw-dotted-lines-on-chalkboards-mit-style/), and [transportation adventures](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/scootin-and-zoomin/). During these past few weeks, I’ve been spending lots of time with friends and doing things, partly because we’re all now vaccinated and can see each other without worry, partly because this is the last time many of my friends are in Boston, partly because I’m no longer busy with school. This makes for much less time by myself to sit alone with my thoughts, to reflect on what these last four years have been. Time to think about questions like “Why don’t I feel like this is the end of an era of my life?” or “How have I changed over my four years of MIT?” or “What growing do I still have to do / want to do in grad school?”

On the advice side — I think that this is less about me, but just a fundamental problem with giving advice. The way that most people make advice is that:

1. (Optional) You receive advice from other people, and maybe choose to follow some of it. 
2. You go through life in some way, and things either go well for you or they don’t.
3. Based on your experiences in step 2, and maybe by compiling useful advice from step 1, you give advice to anyone who wants advice (and sometimes to people who don’t want it, too).

But by nature of human existence, advice that works for one person might not work for someone else. The advice that worked for the advice-giver is very largely dependent on who they are as a person; moreover, there’s a decent amount of randomness involved in whether a given piece of advice worked out for you or not. As an example, so many celebrities say to keep working and to follow your dreams, in part because it worked for them; but will that work for you? Were they just lucky?

So perhaps some advice about advice — meta-advice, if you will. 

* If you’re giving advice, be aware that you’re speaking from your own knowledge set. Not everyone has the same values, or thinks in the same way, and wants the same things out of life. What worked for you might not apply globally to everyone. And you might not have the experience to distinguish the two. And be very, very, conscious of that as you talk to other people. 
* If you’re receiving advice, especially from someone who doesn’t personally know you: Why does that person think that what they’re saying is good advice? What experiences have they had? Are they the same kind of person as you — and if not, different in what ways? And so do you think their advice will work for you?

Hi, this is Paolo from 3 hours later. I’ve written nearly 1,000 words trying to answer my own prompt above. But as I kept writing, I kept feeling like I was trying to give advice that my heart wasn’t fully into.

I tried writing about being a senior, and how I don’t really feel like my time at MIT. But there wasn’t anything more that I could really say about that, in part because I haven’t figured out for myself why I don’t feel that way. Sure, there’s a lot of very easy explanations for this feeling. COVID-19 took away my senior year, and virtual classes/graduation don’t have the same sense of closure or finality. I’m staying in the area for the next five-ish years, doing a PhD, and so I’m not really going anywhere new. And the first two years of grad school will function a lot like undergrad, taking classes and tests, so not much will be changing for a while. But somehow, I feel like it’s more than that, more than just “the time flies fast, so you should make the most of it”. And I can’t figure out how to write about that vague, amorphous feeling.

And so I tried writing about my feelings coming into graduate school, and how they compared to my feelings coming into college. But I haven’t figured out what those feelings are, 









I could sit here and think for hours upon hours about what advice has been the most impactful for me, and what advice I’d give based on my own experience. But I can’t rush that process — it will come in time. Maybe it’ll happen over the course of this road trip, maybe it’ll take all summer, maybe I’ll need a few months of graduate school to understand exactly what I cared about in undergrad.

Those reflections will happen eventually, I am sure; I am not the kind of person to push them aside forever. But that still leaves the question — what am I to leave you with for my blog that says goodbye?

I don’t feel old. Don’t feel like I’m a senior or graduating in literally 4 days. Don’t feel like it’s time for so many goodbyes. 

Perhaps part of it is that I feel like college has passed so quickly. It really doesn’t feel like four years have passed since I started; it stills feel like I ought to have more time to explore MIT, to meet cool people, to join interesting clubs, to take cool classes. And so maybe I’m feeling a lack of senior-ness because of that.

Or maybe it’s because I haven’t had the time yet to reflect on how this next chapter of life will be different. After I committed to MIT, I spent a lot of time thinking about what college would be like, how I’d enjoy living alone, ways that I wanted to grow. But I’ve yet to do that same process for grad school — and so maybe when that happens, I’ll feel it more.

Or perhaps it’s just the fact that I am older, and when there’s more years behind you, the quicker they pass. The four years of high school seemed to be jam-packed with things that I did, and they felt so much longer than the four years I spent at MIT.  The older that you get, the fewer new experiences there are left to live through, and so maybe you perceive the days and weeks and months as faster.

Is it any of these? Is it all? Is it none? I don’t know. But whatever it is, I don’t feel ready to graduate.

1. When you get to college, treasure the moments that you get to spend here, the time you get to spend around your people, the lifelong memories that you are making. They’ll be over before you know it. 

[*Wow, that’s such a platitude. So many people have said that before. Do I have any interesting advice to about how to approach college at all, how to make the most of your few years? It’s hard to come up with such thoughts, especially under time pressure — we’ve got about 3 hours left on this flight. We’ll see what happens.]*

A friend recently told me about a question he was asked: how often do you think about the past, present, and future? I tend to not be much of a forward-looking person (as was my friend), but he told me about someone else who said they think about the future a lot, in part because it makes them happy. Because it gives them hope.

When I think about graduate school, I don’t get very excited. Not to say that I’m not excited — I think I’ll study cool things and do cool research and living in Boston for 5 more years sounds very fun (for now). But it’s not the same as the eyes-wide-open-and-full-of-wonder feeling I remember having when I came to MIT (or even when I came to high school — I moved from Iowa to Nevada between 8th and 9th grade). This summer, I plan to spend much more time figuring out exactly where the excitement is, and what I’m looking forward to. 

2. Try to be conscious of the fact of living. Conscious of your emotions and thoughts, where they come from, whether you want them to be different. Conscious of what goals you have. If you put zero thought into these things, life will still happen, but it might not happen in the ways that you want. 

I know exactly where this piece of advice comes from. It comes from the fact that I try to introspect and think a lot. I don’t want to over-glorify this way of living; I know that I often have choice paralysis because I think too damn much about everything. But at the same time, I do think that a little bit of introspection every now and then is good for everyone.

When I think about the past four years of college, I wonder a lot about how I’ve changed. There’s many ways, I’m sure. I’ve had so many new experiences — living on my own, leading different clubs, being around new people, being in a relationship — but pinpointing hte exact impact that everything has had on me is impossible. The world doesn’t have clear-cut chains of cause and effect, because everything impacts everything else









Like all good things, my time here at MIT is reaching an end. Th eh
