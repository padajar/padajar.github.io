so life odn’t pass me by





* tension between trying to be very consicous about my social life, beuase i know i don’t hang out with people in ways i like without being consicous about t, vs. always being hosed
* so the quesiton is why do i hose myself



there is a cycle in my life of . i juts go through and i find myself sad, and hten i try ot be really conscious abotu what i’m doing, and then i slip andi recur. is this forever? will this always happen?

it gets at the deeper quesiton of “am i happy right now”. there are a lot of things that i am doing doing in my life that are bringing me joy. making closer friends with some poeple. a cappella is fun to sing . i run study breaks that are fun.

this is the fundamental tension i feel between the ethos i talk about in leaning in, and other posts.
