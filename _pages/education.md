Over the past 5 years, I've grown to care a lot about the field of education. I started off by teaching competition math to elementary and middle school students, and I keep teaching in various ways to this day. Since then, I've become much more interested in expanding educational opportunities and educational policy.

## leadership

MIT Educational Studies Programs ([website](https://esp.mit.edu/)) <a name="esp"></a>
: *Chair, Summer HSSP Director, Community Working Group Director*
: ESP runs giant educational programs for middle and high school students with the motto "Teach Anything, Learn Anything." Some examples of classes taught at our programs can be found [down below](#esp-classes). I joined ESP because I thought it was the way to start teaching at their programs. It turns out that's not true at all, but I've stuck around ESP anyways. This club is filled with some of the most wonderful people I've met at MIT, people who care about keeping organizations running well, the state of education in the world, and just life in general. No matter how long I stay in ESP, there's always some way I feel like I'm growing or feeling like I'm contributing — serving as Chair for the club or a mentor for new directors, implementing the MIT Minors Policy, or finding ways to bring a sense of community to our programs. I love ESP a lot, and joining this club was the best decision I made at MIT.

Northeast Regional Middle School Science Bowl ([website](https://www.mitsciencebowl.com/))
: *Coordinator*
: I loved science bowl in middle and high school, and by sheer coincidence, I've ended up as the coordinator for the Northeast Regional Middle School Science Bowl, one of 48 competitions across the country where middle school teams can qualify for the [National Science Bowl](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb). Running this science bowl regional gives me a chance to leave my mark on how these competitions operate. NERMSSB is only in its 5<sup>th</sup> year of organization, and so there's hopefully a lot of lessons I can bring from ESP to help it continue to be run well. Above all, NERMSSB is a great way to just have fun with other science bowl alumni being on the other side of the competition.

## teaching

TA for 14.02 (Principles of Macroeconomics), 2021
: While macroeconomics isn’t my main field of interest, I think that introductory macro courses have a unique place pedagogically in the economics curriculum, since it’s taken by both students who want to develop macroeconomic literacy and those that are exploring economics as a major. I spent much time thinking about how to be as helpful to students to possible. In subject evaluations, my recitation received a 6.5/7 for “Instructor supported learning”, and some students specifically commented on my intuitive explanations, question-answering, and patience c:

TA for 14.27 (Economics and E-Commerce), 2019
: This was my first chance to teach economics in a meaningful capacity. MIT Economics TAs are typically graduate students, and to my knowledge I'm one of only two undergraduate TAs for the department in recent memory. While my TAing wasn't perfect (making mistakes in office hours, imperfect recitation timing), I'd like to think I did a fairly good job in terms of helping students (overall rating 5.5/7). The most fun I had here was getting to design recitations to introduce students to game theory, and creating problems that relate to some of the economics research that I do about competition.

MIT Global Teaching Labs — Italy, 2019
: As part of [MIT GTL](http://misti.mit.edu/global-teaching-labs), I traveled to Italy and designed week-long courses about relativity and statistics to 3<sup>rd</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> years in high school. GTL was a great chance to teach in an environment with high stakes, as the students I taught would need to know this content for their end-of-year exams. More in-depth thoughts about GTL can be found on a blog made by members of ESP doing GTL, [Splash on Planes](https://espgtl.home.blog/author/paoloadajar/). 

Cybermath Academy/Star League Programs, 2016–2018
: Math camps were my first experience with serious teaching: planning lessons, making exercises, and managing classrooms with middle and elementary school students. I first taught at these camps after my junior year of high school, and they're the reason that I grew interested in education. For three straight summers I helped students prepare for Mathcounts competitions, and enjoyed (almost) every bit of it. These programs helped me find my own teaching style (trying to be engaging, enthusiastic, and explaining concepts from intuition as much as possible) that I keep today.
