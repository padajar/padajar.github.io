title: infrequently asked questions
---



**iaq** *noun*, pl. **iaqs** **:** **1.** initialism for “infrequently asked questions”, a riff on *frequently asked questions*; **2:** a way for people to ask me very inane things by submitting them [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx3GqkDudgWlpfbI7Pa0IrRgqp4pz1BKPDypk_HMdmEJdrDQ/viewform)[^1]; **3:** a page you should definitely share with anyone who will ask a fun question so that one day it will be half as cool as [bill wurtz’s](https://billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html) **4:** an experimental section on my website!

what is your favorite pair of anagrams
: did you mean “a sofa fairy hunts water vapor origami”?
: jk. but i think i’ll always have a soft spot for “eleven plus two = twelve plus one”, though “the Morse code = here comes dots” is a close second. and while not my favorite, an incredible construction is [Washington Crossing the Delaware](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Washington_Crossing_the_Delaware_(sonnet))

Who are you really?
: well, what *defines* a person? is it the things that they do? the values they hold? the identities they take? the ways that they are perceived?  the ways they want to be perceived? is the self defined by the way one wants to define oneself or the ways in which others define them? and what happens when all of these are context dependent? sure, one may [contains multitudes](https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-51), but when you look at them from afar, what type of person do they add up to to? perhaps this is an impossible question to answer, and there is no such thing as a self.   
: just kidding. i’m a large language model trained on all of paolo’s blogs and messages. there’s no way a human could write all this nonsense.

bees?
: hell yeah. according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. the bee, of course, flies anyways, because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible. yellow, black. yellow, black. yellow, black. yellow, black. ooh, black and yellow, let’s shake things up a little

what is your favorite question?

when you find yourself in times of trouble, does mother mary come to you? if so, what words does she speak to you? if not, why
: she does! she says “how did i get here? i’m only supposed to go somewhere when someone says ‘mother mary’ three times, and i think it is very clear that you did not since three is the highest number you can count to”
