Here's a lot more random things that I participate in and enjoy, ranging from the semi-serious to the definitely-not-serious.

interests
---------

A Cappella
: For the first two years of grad school, I was part of the [MIT Centrifugues](http://centrifugues.mit.edu), a group that sings predominantly mashups and medleys. I sang baritone, learned how to arrange songs and beatbox, and was a Music Directors for a bit c: I hadn't been a part of organized music since middle school, and have greatly enjoyed getting reacquainted with my musical side. My favorite arrangement was my "Senior" Solo, a mash-up of Vienna and Landslide --- link coming soon!

Musicals
: I love musicals! Favorite ones I’ve seen in-person are Hadestown, Waitress, and Les Mis. I've also recently tried out acting, participating in the Next Act 2023 show, *Remembering Her*! I played Kevin, a wholesome, slightly empty-headed, Prius-driving highschooler who forgets his girlfriend (but eventually remembers!). Shyeah! (Perhaps more acting to come...)

Bouldering
: I picked up bouldering right before starting grad school. I'm currently considering defecting from [Boston Bouldering Project](https://www.bostonboulderingproject.com/) to [Central Rock Gym](https://centralrockgym.com/cambridge/), and climb roughly at a V3 level. I go much less regularly than I’d like to given how busy graduate school is, but enjoy it every time I go.

Puzzle Hunts
: I participate in [Mystery Hunt](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MIT_Mystery_Hunt) (and many smaller hunts) with NES, a team composed of many former and current residents of Next House (my undergraduate dorm). I do hunts because they’re fun events to think hard about incredibly unproductive things were there is an answer to find, and also just to reconnect with friends.

Crosswords
: In 2022, I finally subscribed to NYT Games and began doing the crossword daily. At this point, I can solve them without needing any hints, but still working on bringing down my averages to competition level :P

Biking
: Over the past few years, I've gotten into taking long bike rides! Hoping to start getting into bikepacking over the next summer or two as well.

Deep Discussions
: I love talking to people to learn more about who they are and how they see the world. One semester, I ran a small discussion series to bring strangers together to talk about big questions like “How do you define yourself?” and “What brings meaning to your life?”

Jeopardy
: I’ve always wanted to make it onto to show. Now that I’m past college-age (and thus only eligible for regular Jeopardy), I’m slowly working on shoring my literature and pop culture knowledge. Fingers crossed.
