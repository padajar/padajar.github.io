Here's a lot more random things that I participate in and enjoy, ranging from the semi-serious to the definitely-not-serious.

interests
---------

Memory
: For a class I taught at Splash, I learned how to memorize a deck of cards in a month. Current record is \~8 minutes. I also try to remember all the random facts that people tell me, from birthdays to class schedules to more.

Musicals
: I love musicals! Favorite ones I’ve seen in-person are Hadestown, Waitress, and Les Mis (and I know the soundtracks to dozens more).

Scrabble
: Word games are fun, and Scrabble is my favorite. I’ve taught Splash classes about strategy and two-letter words. One long-term goal of mine is to join competitive Scrabble tournaments.

Jeopardy
: I’ve always wanted to make it onto Jeopardy. My main weaknesses right now are in literature and pop culture, so I’m trying to slowly build up that knowledge to have a shot at qualifying. Fingers crossed.

Deep Discussions
: I love talking to people to learn more about who they are and how they see the world. One semester, I ran a small discussion series to bring strangers together to talk about big questions like “How do you define yourself?” and “What brings meaning to your life?”

Rubik’s Cube Solving
: I got into cubing in high school, though don’t do it much these days. My fastest 3×3 solve is 11.08s, and fastest 3×3 blindfolded is 3:31.
