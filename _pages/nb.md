hi! i’m nonbinary and use **they/them pronouns**.

i used to go by a different name,[^1] which you may have heard before. however, i ask that you don’t use it when talking with or about me, because i don’t feel like it fits “me” anymore. it’s somewhat like when a person decides they want to go by a nickname, or change their last name after getting married — it’s just that this one happens to be associated with gender identity.

please don’t feel bad if you use the wrong name and pronouns for me; i trust you have good intentions, and made an honest mistake. there’s no need to make a big deal of it!

if it happens and i hear it, i’ll take a quick moment to correct you. if you hear someone else use the wrong name and pronouns, i’d greatly appreciate if you them know! (please feel free to do this regardless of if i’m physically present or not; it means a lot when other people help with this.)

[^1]: this is commonly referred to as a “deadname” in the lgbtq+ community; see [here](https://upliftphilly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gender-101_-Avoiding-Misgendering-and-Deadnaming.pdf) for more info
