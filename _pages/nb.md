hi! i’m **nonbinary** and **use they/them pronouns**. nonbinary means different things for different people — in my case, i just don’t feel like being a man or a woman fits me right now. by writing this page, by saying i’m nonbinary, by putting my pronouns on my website, the way the world perceives me becomes more aligned with the way that i see myself.

please don’t feel bad if you accidentally use the pronouns for me; i trust you have good intentions, and made an honest mistake. there’s no need to make a big deal of it! i will, however, take a quick moment to correct you so long as i’m around. 

relatedly, if you hear someone using the wrong pronouns, i’d greatly appreciate if you let them know! you can do this regardless of whether or not i’m around —  it means a lot when other people help out with this.

i used to go by a different name,[^1] which you may have heard before. just like using the right pronouns for me, you should **use my name — phi — and not a name i used to go by**. it’s somewhat like when a person decides they want to go by a nickname, or if they change their last name after getting married — it’s just that this one happens to be associated with the fact that i’m nonbinary. the things about pronouns also apply to names — i’ll correct you if you happen to use the wrong name, and i’d appreciate your help in correcting others. 

[^1]: this is commonly referred to as a “deadname” in the lgbtq+ community; see [here](https://upliftphilly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gender-101_-Avoiding-Misgendering-and-Deadnaming.pdf) for more info
