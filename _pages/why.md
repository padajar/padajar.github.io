hey, you. yeah, you. you just clicked a link to my website while *on* my website.

i mean, i *suppose* that’s allowed but…  why?

oh well. it doesn’t really matter now.

anyways, don't want to take up too much of your time, so sending you back to the homepage in <span id="countdowntimer">10</span> seconds.

<script type="text/javascript">
    var timeleft = 10;
    var downloadTimer = setInterval(function(){
    timeleft--;
    document.getElementById("countdowntimer").textContent = timeleft;
    if(timeleft <= 0)
        clearInterval(downloadTimer);
    },1000);
</script>
