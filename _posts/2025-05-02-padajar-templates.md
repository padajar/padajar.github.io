[a few years ago]({% post_url 2021-07-04-pset-template %}), i made a $\LaTeX$ setup to help me format my grad school psets. it’s been pretty successful — it helped me keep my psets organized, got a couple of compliments and “hey what template are you using”, and even a few random emails here and there.

but as someone who’s no longer taking classes, most $\LaTeX$ documents i write these days are either slides or memos. and so figured it was time to make some new templates for those.

after some work (much of which was procrasti-productivity when i had to be doing other stuff), i have *finally* created some new templates that supersede the old paolo-pset — introducing, [padajar-templates](https://github.com/padajar/padajar-templates/tree/main)!

these templates are now available on github under a mit license. a few extra design notes of interest that i didn’t include in the above pdf:

* everything uses IBM Plex, which is the same font i use on my website and my cv. yay for consistent branding! 
* ashamed to admit it took far too long to figure out where exactly to put this in my texlive installations. oof.
* yes, it is based on the same orange theme as my website. however, given the thinness of the font, i’ve also made it just a _tad_ darker.

anyways, hope this gets some mileage from some poeple!
