<p>Welcome to my blog, a place where I try to put some amorphous thoughts into words, take snapshots of my personhood, and share it all with the interwebs. See below for recent posts, or sort by <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog/categories>category</a>.</p>

<p>Some personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>In undergrad, these three posts (<a href={{ site.baseurl }}/2020/07/29/choices-arbitraryness-storytelling/>1</a>, <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/on-success-meaning-and-time/">2</a>, <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/leaning-in/">3</a>), chronicled my eventual choice to go to econ grad school, with plenty of musings on values, happiness, life, and much more.</li>
<li>My favorite “teaching” post is my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/2025/03/15/mdrd/>mdrd primer</a>, though I'm also quite fond of <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/joshua-angrist-shares-the-nobel-prize/">quasi-experimental methods</a> and <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/in-honor-of-tau/">tau</a>. </li>
<li>For fun potpourri, read about <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/dormspam-the-game-part-3/">running dormspam-the-game</a> (with <a href="http://whitneyzhang.com/">Whitney</a>!) or my love letters to  <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-draw-dotted-lines-on-chalkboards-mit-style/">chalkboards</a> and <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-restore-an-old-whiteboard/">whiteboards</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the past, I blogged for <a href=https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/padajar/>MIT Admissions</a>; many older blogs are hosted there.</p>
