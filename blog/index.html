<p>Welcome to my blog, filled with musings about life and more. You can view recent posts below, but can also sort by <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog/categories>category</a>, <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog/tags>tags</a>, or <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog/posts>year</a>.</p>

<p>Some personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>These three posts (<a href={{ site.baseurl }}/2020/07/29/choices-arbitraryness-storytelling/>one</a>, <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/on-success-meaning-and-time/">two</a>, <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/leaning-in/">three</a>), chronicle how I chose to go to graduate school, with musings on my values, choices, economics, happiness, and much more.</li>
<li>To see my teaching style (no posts on my pedagogical philosophy yet), the best example is my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/2025/03/15/mdrd/>mdrd primer</a>. For less complicated subject matter, see my posts about <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/joshua-angrist-shares-the-nobel-prize/">quasi-experimental methods</a> and <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/in-honor-of-tau/">tau</a>. </li>
<li>For fun potpourri, read about <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/dormspam-the-game-part-3/">running dormspam-the-game</a> (with <a href="http://whitneyzhang.com/">Whitney</a>!), <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-draw-dotted-lines-on-chalkboards-mit-style/">chalkboards</a>, and <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-restore-an-old-whiteboard/">whiteboards</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Many of my blogs are hosted on <a href=https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/padajar/>MIT Admissions</a>, where I was an official blogger my senior year, and an occasional poster at the start of graduate school.</p>
