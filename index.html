<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#ff6000;">paolo adajar</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>I'm a second-year PhD student at MIT in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>economics</a>, with interests in education, IO, and behavioral economics. My studies are supported by the <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. </p>

<p> My interest in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> extends beyond research; I enjoy thinking about teaching, pedagogy, and running educational programs. In my spare time, I do too many <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other things</a>, one of which is writing; I maintain a <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a> on this site with my thoughts and reflections as I go through life.</p>

<p>I made this website to show the parts of my life that exist beyond a <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/cv>CV</a>. In doing so, I hope to bring a bit of humanity and authenticity into the world, and maybe, just maybe, something here will resonate with you and your own journey.</p>
