<p>i'm a fifth-year phd candidate (already? yeesh.) in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>economics</a> at mit, studying education policy through the lenses of market design, development, and io. my studies are supported by the <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>nsf grfp</a> and an <a href=https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/doctoral-dissertation-fellowships-global-math-talent/doctoral-dissertation-fellowships-global-math-talent-fellows>nber dissertation fellowship</a>. </p>

<p> my interest in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> extends beyond research; i enjoy thinking about teaching, pedagogy, and running educational programs. in my spare time, i do too many <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other things</a>, one of which is writing; you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a> for various reflections and musings on my life.</p>

<p>this site exists to help people get to know me beyond the boring line items on a <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/cv>cv</a>. in doing so, i hope to bring some personness onto the interwebs, and maybe, just maybe, you'll get something from visitng my website c:</p>
