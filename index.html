<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#f47c44;">paolo adajar</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>i'm a fourth-year phd candidate at mit in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>economics</a>, with interests in education, development, market design, and io. my studies are supported by the <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>nsf graduate research fellowship</a>. </p>

<p> my interest in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> extends beyond research; i enjoy thinking about teaching, pedagogy, and running educational programs. in my spare time, i do too many <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other things</a>, one of which is writing; you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a> to hear my thoughts and reflections as i go through life.</p>

<p>i made this website to help others know the person behind my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/cv>cv</a>. in doing so, i hope to bring a bit of humanity and authenticity into the world, and maybe, just maybe, you'll find something that is relevant for your own life.</p>

<p>if you have questions, comments, or thoughts, feel free to <a href="mailto:paoloadajar@mit.edu">say hi</a>!</p>
