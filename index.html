<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#f47c44;">paolo adajar</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>I'm a third-year PhD candidate at MIT in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>economics</a>, with interests in education, development, market design, and IO. My studies are supported by the <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. </p>

<p> My interest in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> extends beyond research; I enjoy thinking about teaching, pedagogy, and running educational programs. In my spare time, I do too many <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other things</a>, one of which is writing; you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a> to hear my thoughts and reflections as I go through life.</p>

<p>I made this website to help others know the person behind my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/cv>CV</a>. In doing so, I hope to bring a bit of humanity and authenticity into the world, and maybe, just maybe, you'll find something that is relevant for your own life.</p>

<p>If you have questions, comments, or thoughts, feel free to <a href="mailto:paoloadajar@mit.edu">say hi</a>!</p>
