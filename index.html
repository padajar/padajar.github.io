<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#f47c44;">paolo</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>i'm a rising fifth-year phd candidate (who cannot believe they're already a fifth-year) in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>economics</a> at mit, studying education policy through the lenses of market design, development, and io. my studies are supported by the <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>nsf grfp</a> and an <a href=https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/doctoral-dissertation-fellowships-global-math-talent/doctoral-dissertation-fellowships-global-math-talent-fellows>nber dissertation fellowship</a>. </p>

<p> my interest in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> extends beyond research; i enjoy thinking about teaching, pedagogy, and running educational programs. in my spare time, i do too many <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other things</a>, one of which is writing; you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a> to hear my thoughts and reflections as i go through life.</p>

<p>i made this website to help people get to know me beyond the boring line items on a <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/cv>cv</a>. in doing so, i hope to bring a bit of humanity and authenticity onto the interwebs, and i hope you can get something, anything, out of perusing this site c:</p>

<p>if you have questions, comments, or thoughts, please <a href="mailto:paoloadajar@mit.edu">say hi</a>! (or, just ask away on my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/iaq>iaq</a> page!)</p>
