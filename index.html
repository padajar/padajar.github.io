<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#ff6000;">paolo adajar</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>I'm a first-year PhD student at MIT in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>economics</a>; I'm still figuring out my fields of interest, but for now, I like education, market design, behavioral, and development. My research and studies are supported by the <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. </p>

<p>I'm also involved in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> and <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other random things</a>. For thoughts, reflections, and updates on what I've been up to, you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a>. My <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/2020/05/18/beginnings/>first blog post</a> elaborates on the main goal of this website: helping people get to know me beyond just "stuff I did". But if you do just want that, you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/cv>CV</a>.</p>
