<p><span style="font-size:xxx-large;"><strong>hi! i'm <span style="color:#f47c44;">phi</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>i'm a fifth-year phd candidate in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/economics>economics</a> at mit. i'm an education economist, and i study gaps in access, opportunity, and achievement through the lenses of market design, development, and io. my studies are supported by the <a href=https://www.nsfgrfp.org/>nsf grfp</a> and an <a href=https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/doctoral-dissertation-fellowships-global-math-talent/doctoral-dissertation-fellowships-global-math-talent-fellows>nber dissertation fellowship</a>. </p>

<p> my interest in <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/education>education</a> extends beyond research; i enjoy thinking about teaching, pedagogy, and running educational programs. in my spare time, i do too many <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/more>other things</a>, one of which is writing; you can check out my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/blog>blog</a> for various reflections and musings on my life.</p>

<p>i'd like to think i'm defined by many things beyond those on my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/cv>cv</a>. in making this site, i hope to share some of those aspects, some of those multitudes i contain. and by putting all these different parts of my person-ness online, maybe you'll find something that brings you use. or a little connection. or maybe even a little joy. </p>

<p>if you have questions, comments, or thoughts, please <a href="mailto:phiadajar@mit.edu">say hi</a>! (or, just ask away on my <a href={{ site.baseurl }}/iaq>iaq</a> page!)</p>
